Operating System from Scratch project #1 (Stuck at IDT configuration)
___
This is not much, but also not honest work. I was following along the os-dev book

It was first time of me writing operating system, so this is kind of spaghetti code. 

## What I wrote:
- Bootloader
  - print / printhex
  - disk read/write
  - protected mode & gdt

- Screen driver for text based interface
- Incomplete C stdlib
  - print / println
  - clear screen
  - scroll functionality
  - memset / memcopy
  - IO bus byte read/write funcs
